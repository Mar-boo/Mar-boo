## Hello world 👋

Data Analyst with experience in quantitative analysis, information processing and management, and clear reporting with Power BI and RMarkdown. I enjoy working with data 😸: cleaning, organizing, and transforming it into useful insights :computer:. I am proficient in programming and analytical tools, with experience in technical documentation, validation, and data traceability. I am accustomed to gathering requirements, detecting inefficiencies, and improving processes through data-driven solutions. 
I combine technical precision with analytical thinking and a focus on continuous learning :seedling:.
